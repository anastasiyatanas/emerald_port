                  <h1>BIOGRAPHY/ABOUT PAGE:</h1>
            
                    <a>My Life: I was born and raised in Colorado, spending much of my childhood hiking and camping in the Rocky Mountains. 
                    I began drawing at a young age, creating characters and imagining unusual worlds to sketch. 
                    I am now a student at the University of Colorado Denver, studying Illustration and have turned my love of drawing into more than a hobby. 
                    I take much of my inspiration from the world around me, especially when I’m far away from the city, hiking and exploring.
                     There is something about waking up on a chill, misty mountain morning or a walking through dusky woods that makes me want to paint the scene and capture that feeling forever. 
                     Through my illustrations, I try to create portals to other worlds, each with their own memories and their own histories. 
                    Being a lover of history, I also take a more traditional approach with my artwork, using mainly traditional media. 
                    I’m always experimenting with new media, and I use digital programs as an extension of the traditional work. 
                    I enjoy the textural quality that is achieved from brushstrokes on paper or canvas, and strive to emulate a somewhat Impressionistic style into my illustrations. Detail is incredibly important to me, especially when aiming to tell a story through a picture. 
                    Despite generally working on a smaller scale, many of my illustrations include tiny, sometimes hidden details that add more background to each story.  
                  </a>
                   <br>
                    <h1>How I Make My Illustrations: </h1>
                    <a>I always start each illustration with pencil and paper, scrawling down notes and thumbnails until an idea clicks. 
                      I like to experiment with different materials; however, I always start off with traditional media, drawing out a final sketch and then working with any assortment of acrylic paints, ink, colour pencils, watercolours, or gouache. 
                      Everything ends up being scanned and touched up in Photoshop. </a>
            
                    <h1>My Favourite Illustrators: </h1>
            
                    <a>I’ve always been very impressed with the painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, such as Albrecht Durer and Caravaggio. 
                      I love looking at old paintings and seeing the history that is depicted behind each one. 
                      The Impressionists are probably who I draw most of my influence from though. 
                      As for modern illustrators, I am a huge fan of John Kenn Mortensen and his sticky note monster series, as well as Jim Kay’s beautiful work on a Monster Calls and the Harry Potter illustrated books. 
                      Pascal Campion is another of today’s illustrators who I admire greatly. 
                      His work with lighting is simply brilliant. </a>
